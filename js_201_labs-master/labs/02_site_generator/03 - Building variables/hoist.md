# Hoisting

Include these exercises in a solutions sandbox for this section.

Write some code necessary to demonstrate:

1. Function hoisting
2. Variable hoisting

 -----------------------------------------
This sandbox demonstrates:
1. Function hoisting: functions can be called before being declared.
2. Variable hoisting:
   - var is hoisted and initialized as undefined.
   - let/const are hoisted but not accessible before declaration (ReferenceError).
